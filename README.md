### rebirth
when you've earned enough *all time* points you can rebirth. resets your score and all upgrades. in return you get a permanent multiplier that never goes away and stacks with future rebirths.

| tier | lifetime pts needed | what you get |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| ascension i | 1,000 | x10 permanent |
| ascension ii | 10,000 | x50 permanent |
| ascension iii | 100,000 | x200 permanent |
| ascension iv | 1,000,000 | x1,000 permanent |
| ascension v | 10,000,000 | x5,000 permanent |
| ascension vi | 1,000,000,000 | x50,000 permanent |

## can types

| can | how to get | worth |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| regular | just spawns | base points |
| golden ⭐ | random 1.3% chance or golden hour | 50x |
| ghost 👻 | buy ghost cans upgrade, 8% chance | 10x, nearly invisible |
| bling 💎 | buy bling mode, every 10th can | 20x |
| rainbow 🌈 | cosmic-tier upgrade can | special |

## tips

- buy miss shield early, missing tanks your combo and feels bad
- can bomb + golden hour = a lot of points very fast
- the streak bonus is passive and silent — just don't miss
- rebirth as soon as you can, the multiplier compounds hard
- ghost cans make a different sound when you accidentally hover them

made with too much free time and a weird affection for the frutiger aero aesthetic
